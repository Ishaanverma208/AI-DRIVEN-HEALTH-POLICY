# 🇮🇳 India HealthSim – AI-Powered Public Health Policy Simulator

**India HealthSim** is a consulting-style analytics project built to simulate the impact of health policy decisions across Indian states using AI/ML. Designed with real-world use cases in mind (ZS Associates, Bain, BCG), this project empowers policymakers to estimate the effect of funding, infrastructure, and outreach programs on public health KPIs.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Help simulate the impact of healthcare investments (funding, telemedicine, clinics, etc.)
- Predict outcomes: Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Rate, and Life Expectancy
- Provide a dashboard that enables "what-if" scenario planning for public health decisions

---

## 🧠 Key Features
- **Covers all 28 Indian states** with customizable policy parameters
- **AI-powered prediction** using Random Forest models trained on simulated socio-health data
- **Interactive Streamlit dashboard** to visualize projected vs. current metrics
- **Policy levers:** Doctors per 1000, clinic coverage, telemedicine, funding, literacy, sanitation, rural population %, internet access

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- Streamlit (dashboard)
- Matplotlib (optional for advanced visualization)
